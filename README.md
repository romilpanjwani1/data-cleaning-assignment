# Data 1202 - Assignment 

## 📌 Project Description

This project showcases a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the popular Superstore Sales dataset using Python. The analysis is done within a Jupyter Notebook and leverages key data science libraries such as **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

The notebook walks through the process of:
- Loading and previewing the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Identifying and handling missing values
- Understanding data types and data distribution
- Generating insightful visualizations to analyze:
  - Sales and profit by category and sub-category
  - Regional performance
  - Quantity and shipping trends
  - Overall sales dynamics

The objective is to extract meaningful business insights that can help drive better decision-making for sales strategy, inventory, and regional focus.
